# YNAP Technical Test

## Author

Andrew Fox, June 2022

## Project Details

The "iOS Developer test" pdf outlines all expectations.

This project was completed in roughly 12 hours using a mix of Swift and SwiftUI.

The target device developed against was the latest Swift/iOS on the iPhone 13 Simulator. All snapshot tests have been set against this combination.

## Suggested Improvements

- Localisation files should be added and replace all hard-coded strings in the app (TODO's have been left in-code as a reminder)
- The "Likes" feature shoud be wired up correctly to enable liking of products, though preferably tied to an account
- Discrete communication error states should be handled and communicated to the user appropriately
- Offline state should be handled
- Improved UI handling of other device sizes, with half an eye on iPad
- Snapshot tests should be fixed to a specific iOS release
