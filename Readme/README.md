## Author

Andrew Fox, June 2022

## Project Details

This project was completed in roughly 12 hours using a mix of Swift and SwiftUI.

The iOS Developer test pdf outlines all expectations.

The snapshot tests have been created using the latest iOS on iPhone 13.

## Suggested Improvements

- Localisation files should be added and replace all hard-coded strings in the app (TODO's have been left in-code as a reminder)
- The "Likes" feature shoud be wired up correctly to enable liking of products
- A mix of discrete communication error states should be handled and communicated to the user appropriately
- Offline state should be handled
